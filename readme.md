# Double Pendulum
This code produces an animation of a double pendulum. This solution is a result of numerical solutions to differential
equations produced by dynamics. In my research, energy methods were used to simplify the set of differential equations, 
but I wanted to be different. 

Also note, you can add an input torque in the `double_pendulum.py` file, which is something that I couldn't find
anywhere else.
